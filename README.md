  ## Description

  A handy Node.js-based tool that allows users to easily generate professional README.md files using a series of simple questions.
  
  ## Installation

  - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your local machine
  - Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine
  - Use your local machine's command-line to navigate to the cloned repo's directory
  - Run "npm install"
  - Run "node index.js"

  ## Usage

  Using this command-line application, users may quickly and efficiently generate a professional README for a new project. Users may answer a series of questions to generate a README using information about the name of their project, a description of their project, installation instructions required for the project, guidelines on how others may contribute to the project, instructions for testing the project, what license they created the project under, their GitHub username, and their email address. After the prompts are successfully answered, a new file named "generated-README.md" is created within the cloned directory, enabling users to modify the new file as they see fit.
